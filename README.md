# personal-to-do-list

This is my first personal project with no real guidance. I am going to try to create a fully functional to-do list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
As I continue to learn, I will try to continue to flesh out this project using the new concepts I learn in the coming months.

Still to do:
  - I want the task counter to update each time a new list item is added 
  - I want to format the datetime to be more readable and friendly
   - I need to create a button to complete each task and move it to a different list
   - I need to create a button to delete a specific task from the page forever
   - I want completed items to move to a different list with visual feedback that the item has been completed
   - I want the option to delete specific items from the page
   - I need to make the styling more appealing
