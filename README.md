# personal-to-do-list

This is my first personal project with no real guidance. I am going to try to create a fully functional to-do list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

As I continue to learn, I will try to continue to flesh out this project using the new concepts I learn in the coming months.

Still to do:

  - I want the task counter to update each time a new list item is added 
  - I want to format the datetime to be more readable and friendly
  - I need to create a button to delete a specific task from the page forever
  - I need to make the styling more appealing 


What I learned in my first try:

  - I got a pretty good understanding of how to manipulate properties of the DOM using event listeners. Specifically, I learned how challenging it can be to access specific DOM elements.
  - I learned that I need a better system to move elements around on the page. The focus of my next project will be on flexbox and on completing getting rid of this weakness
  - I learned that it would be a good idea to get a very clear idea of what I want the end product to look like before I begin. An excellent tool to learn and get fluent with would be Adobe Illustator.
  - It might be a good idea next time to make sure that you overwrite user agent stylesheets before beginning, just in case it is causing unforeseen issues
  - I learned how to manipulate form elements. This includes, grabbing the input value with JavaScript, having placeholder text etc.
  - Elements of project planning including getting a clear idea of what I want to make, outlining the tech required to make it possible, identifying desired features, how to implement those features, and developing a clear timeline for completion
  - I learned that I have a very loose and messy understanding of naming conventions with class and id, as well as how to chain selectors together in CSS. This should also be a focus of my next project.

  

  Features I still want to include:

    - Updating the task counter
    - Learning to program back-end so that the data is saved and not deleted every time the page is refreshed
    - Integration with google calendar if possible
    - Creation of categorized lists beyond just "to-do" and "complete"
    - Reminders to email or to desktop
    - Addition of descriptive information for each task
    - Cleaner code
    - More appealing layout and styling. More experimentation is needed to really see what is possible!
